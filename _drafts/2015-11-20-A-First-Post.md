It's time for the web to be cluttered with another blog about stuff.  This one is going to start out about me hacking together things to use in and around our house.  Who knows where it might end up.

Since WordPress seems to be a bit of a monster, I thought I would use a slightly lighter weight blogging approach.  So for this I am hosting everything in GitHub from which it gets published automatically to GitHub-Pages using Jekyll.  Seems to work so far.

This is an image of the sun.

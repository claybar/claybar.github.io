After cracking a few of my previous [Black Beers]({% post_url 2012-03-05-Black-Beer %})
I decided to try another darkish beer.  But the big question
was what style?  My last few brews have involved adding extra hops with mixed
success.  In the case of the previous Black Beer I liked the flavour the extra
hops added.  In the case of the [Hopped Pale Ale]({% post_url 2012-01-16-Hopped-Pale-Ale %})
things weren't so great, the extra hops seemed a bit much giving a bit of an
off taste.  This may have been the combination of hops I used, the Nelson
Sauvin can have an overpowering flavor according to some brewers.

Rather than tinker with the addition of hops, I decided to keep this brew
'plain' and aim for the more malty end of the scale.  So, a dark beer with a
less than average hops profile was in order.  After a bit of research I came
across the German Bock style.  As usual I didn't want to brew using sugar
since it seems to go against the idea of beer so a can of extra malt was added
to a kit of Bock.

The brew has been in the barrel for a few hours and the airlock has started to
bubble away.  With a bit of luck this brew will be a good everyday drop over
the winter months.

    title: Label

Over the last couple of years life seems to have been very busy and as a
result very little brewing has been taking place.  Instead I have been buying
beer occasionally, but I have noticed the price seems to be ever increasing.
Even for generic mainstream brands the price is approaching $2 a bottle.  With
the summer months upon us a refreshing beverage after work becomes an
expensive hobby.  So, time to get back into home brewing.  I wasn't really
sure what style of beer to make but since it is summertime some form of pale
ale was top of the list.  A quick trip to my [local brewing shop
(LBS)](http://www.bininn.co.nz/locations/lincoln-road) and I was ready to go
with a 'Riwaka Pale Ale'.

Ingredients:

* [Black Rock Riwaka Pale Ale](http://www.blackrock.co.nz/brew-kits/item/73-riwaka-pale-ale) kit.
* [Black Rock Ultra Light](http://www.blackrock.co.nz/malt-extracts/item/67-unhopped-ultra-light) Unhopped Malt Extract.

After filling the barrel to the standard 23L a measurement of the specific
gravity showed 1039, a touch lower than I was expecting.  Should translate to
an alcohol content of around 4-4.5%.  The initial wort was probably a touch
hot, around 26°C but hopefully it works out okay.  The brew has been bubbling
away in the garage for a few days and the temperature seems to have stabilized
on a much better 20-21°C.

The brew can contains a quantity of Riwaka hop pellets, effectively dry-
hopping the beer.  These hops cause a nice layer of green krausen to form on
the surface of the beer, hopefully it can be keep undisturbed during the
bottling process.

# Bottling

After about 7 days brewing it seemed ready for bottling, FG is down to about 1013.
The bottling process went reasonably smoothly, 45 500mL bottles full and capped.

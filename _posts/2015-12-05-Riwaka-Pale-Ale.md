Ingredients:
* [Black Rock Riwaka Pale Ale](http://www.blackrock.co.nz/brew-kits/item/73-riwaka-pale-ale) kit.
* [Black Rock Ultra Light](http://www.blackrock.co.nz/malt-extracts/item/67-unhopped-ultra-light) Unhopped Malt Extract.

After filling the barrel to the standard 23L a measurement of the specific gravity shows 1039, a touch lower than I was expecting.  Should translate to an alcohol content of around 4-4.5%.

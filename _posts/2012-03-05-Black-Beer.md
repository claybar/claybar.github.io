Recently the weather has taken a turn for the worse, although to be fair it
never really got going over summer with lots of [grey
days](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6525665/Grey-summer-breaks-records).
This has got me thinking forward to the winter months when having a big black
beer in the fridge is never a bad thing.  Time for a new brew, so off to the
brew shop for a few supplies.  I didn't really know what I was after but came
away with a couple of cans:

![Label](/images/labels/2012-03-Black.jpg)

- [Mangrove Jack's Irish Stout](http://mangrovejacks.com/products/international-series-irish-stout)
- [Black Rock Dark Malt Extract](http://www.brewshop.co.nz/black-rock-dark-malt-extract.html)

Hopefully this combo isn't too bitter, I hope the extra malt extract adds
something to the body of the beer and leaves the bitterness up to the hops
from the Stout.  Since I have some hops in the freezer I decided to try a hint
of dry hopping too by adding 40g of [Motueka
hops](http://www.nzhops.co.nz/variety/motueka).  I know this goes against the
normal thinking of black beers, but that is the beauty of homebrew, I get to
make the rules.

This brew has been in the drum for about a week now starting out with an SG of
1036.  It is now down to about 1010 and the bubbling has almost stopped, so I
expect it will have an FG of around 1006 when ready for bottling.  This should
give an alcohol content of about 4.0% once the priming sugar is added.

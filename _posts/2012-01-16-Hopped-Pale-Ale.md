When using of pre-made malt extract the general recipe is to add 1kg of sugar
to the contents of the can and add the yeast.  Until now this has been the
general process I have followed, although sometimes experimenting with
different types of sugar or spraymalt/sugar combos.  For this brew I have
dived into the world of adding extra hops.

Hops are added to beer for two purposes, adding bitterness and aroma.  The
canned beer kits generally contain bittering hops but are very limited with
aroma hops since these hops flavors are not preserved in the can.  This gives
an easy entry into the world of hopping without going to whole hog to grain
extraction.

For this brew I used:

- Black Rock East India Pale Ale, 1.5kg can (this contains bittering hops)
- Black Rock Amber Malt Extract, 1.5kg can
- @10min, 20g each [Nelson Sauvin](http://www.nzhops.co.nz/variety/nelson-sauvin) and [Motueka hops](http://www.nzhops.co.nz/variety/motueka)
- @5min, 20g each Nelson Sauvin and Motueka hops
- Yeast from the IPA can
- Dry hop with 40g of Motueka hops.
- OG 1033

For a good explanation of what '@10min' and '@5min' mean, read [Inzane
Brewing](https://inzanebrew.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/recipe-of-my-first-brew-
zapa-zanes-american-pale-ale-extract-recipe/).  Essentially these times refer
to how long the hops are boiled for.

The dry hops need to be added after the initial furious fermentation has
completed.  I expect this will be 4-5 days after initial pitching.

### Things I have learnt

Boiling up hops is rather stinky.  The fumes given off during the boiling
process are rather overpowering.  Future hop boils will either be done outside
with a gas cooker or at least during the day when I can open all the windows
and doors to get more ventilation.

Ever wondered what hops taste like?  I did, so I tried one.  If you are
wondering what they taste like too, I suggest you try one.  It will change
your day.
